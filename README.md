# Customer-Churn-Prediction

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Machine Learning in the AWS SageMaker.  <br>
I took the Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle and built a classification model using  SageMaker's XGBoost model. <br>
In addition to SageMaker learning, I knew how to download a dataset directly from Kaggle and how to use GitHub from the SageMaker.
