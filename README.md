# Customer-Churn-Prediction

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Machine Learning in the AWS SageMaker.  <br><br>
I took the [Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle and built a classification model using  SageMaker's XGBoost model. <br><br>
In addition to SageMaker learning, I knew how to download a dataset directly from Kaggle and how to use GitHub from the SageMaker. <br><br>
